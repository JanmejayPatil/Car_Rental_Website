The company does a car rental business and has several locations with different addresses. The cars are classified as subcompacts, compacts, sedans, or luxury. <br />
Each car has a particular make, model, year made, and color. Each car has a unique identification, number, and a unique license plate. <br />
For every car, we keep the odometer reading and fuel tank reading and display it to the customer at the time of placing the order so heâ€™s aware of the present state and condition of the car. We charge the customers day-wise according to the price of the car rented. <br />
We also allow our Employees to rent the cars as well, they go through the same portal and need to fill in the same information and being the employee they receive a discount on basis of their level of position in the company. <br />
There is also an Employee Section mentioned on the website for the ADMIN to check on the database reports and to alter information from the database. <br />
